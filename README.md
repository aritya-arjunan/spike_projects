# Code and Pictures of Robots

## Description

I create robots creatively, without using the building instructions. As a result, some parts may be unstable when completed. This is perfectly normal and do not get stressed about it. I use the LEGO® Education SPIKE™ kit and app. 

## Project List

* The Digitaliser. This robot is fed paper with colours on it, and is able to detect the amount of raw red, green, and blue on it, as well as the light reflection and what colour does the colour sensor detect.

### Installing

* Download the LEGO® Education SPIKE™ App [here](https://education.lego.com/en-au/downloads/spike-app/software/)
* In the first dropdown, select your device type
* In the second dropdown, select "Download - 3.4.5"
* Click on the black button that says "Download - 3.4.5" to download app
* Download files and double click to open them
